I have no idea what I'm doing.
## Goals
* an app that allows you to enter recipes
* app allows you to enter what food you have
  * you also need to be able to enter expiration date
* you must be able to pick a recipe and automatically generate a grocery list
* you must be able to mark a recipe as "cooked" which will automatically decrement the food in your pantry
* app will store data in a SQLite database


Damn I haven't touched this in a minute, committing this to see if my PC is configured right
